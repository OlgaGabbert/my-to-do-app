## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main components:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure and layout of the To-Do App.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the app and makes it visually appealing.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that adds functionality to the app.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You should see the To-Do App interface.

3. You can start using the app by following these steps:
   - Enter a task description in the text input field.
   - Click the "+" button to add the task to the list.
   - Click on a task in the list to mark it as completed (this will strike through the task).
   - Click the "x" button to delete a task from the list.

4. The app will store your tasks locally, so you can close the browser and return later to see your tasks are still there.
